My name is Justin Tran. I'm a software engineer and I currently reside in Riverview, FL.

I enjoy making things out of pure boredom. Most of my projects come from sheer laziness or just to have something to do.
Most of the time I end up automating something because I'm too lazy to do the small task every time. My goal is to make something
that is not only challenging for myself, but can also be of some obscure use to some individual out there.

I have a Bachelor's Degree from the University of South Florida in Computer Science. I'm currently on the never-ending job hunt, which
admittedly is much more difficult with the COVID-19 pandemic going on at (time of writing).

My language of choice is Python, as it's the language I first started with. However, I do have an interest in some other languages and frameworks.
My interests include:

- Front-end Development
  - JavaScript
  - HTML/CSS

- Back-end Development
  - Python
  - C/C++
  - Java
  - SQL

- Tools
  - Bash
  - Git
  - MySQL

I would generally love to expand my knowledge in these areas, possibly getting into React or Node.js, maybe even Django or Flask.
Who knows what I'll end up getting into next?
