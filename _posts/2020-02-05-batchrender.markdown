This project idea formed because I used to run overnight renders using Sony Vegas 14. Sometimes, I would have multiple projects to render. Instead of manually doing it, I wrote a small script to render all project files in a given directory and shut down your PC. This originally measures CPU utilization and makes a decision based on a certain utilization threshold. I may revisit this project in the future, as it manipulates cursor placement instead of active windows. You can check it out [here!][repo]
